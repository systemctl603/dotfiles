# Dotfiles

Dotfiles that I use, along with an install.sh script to set them up automatically.

## Notes

Stow is needed to run the install script.

<!-- TODO: Add two scripts, ({push,pull}_dotfiles), to quickly update the github repo and the local install  -->
<!-- TODO: Install dependencies automatically with nix -->
