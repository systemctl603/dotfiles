# Dotfiles

Dotfiles that I use, along with an install.sh script to set up an environment automatically.

## Installation

Oneline install currently broken.
~~For a oneline install, Run this: \
`curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/systemctl603/dotfiles/master/install.sh" | bash`~~

To install manually:

- Clone the repo to ~/.dotfiles
- Run the install.sh

## Notes

Stow is needed to run the install script.
